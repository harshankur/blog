I am happy to have finally set up this blog, which I had been intending to for the last few months. The primary objective for me in setting up this blog is to have a place of my own to dump my thoughts, my learnings, my experiences, and anything else I find useful to share with the world. I am aware that only a few people will ever discover this blog, but I am glad to finally have one that is not on social media.

#### Topics I will primarily cover:
- Programming
- Technology
- Science
- Travel
- Books
- Culture
- History
- Psychology
- Cosmos

#### About Me
My name is Harsh Ankur. I was born in Dhanbad 🇮🇳, brought up in Kolkata 🇮🇳, completed my high school in Vijayawada 🇮🇳, and graduated from my B.Tech. and M.Tech. in Mumbai 🇮🇳. The most difficult question I come across is when a person from India asks me "_So, where are you from?_"

After my graduation, I got placed at a Japanese multinational, Konica Minolta, for which I went to live and work as a software developer in Tokyo 🇯🇵. Out of all the things that I have learned in Japan, the importance of **quality** and **punctuality** stand out the most. In 2022, I moved to Berlin 🇩🇪 to work at SOFHA GmbH. In Germany, my biggest learnings so far have been **productivity** and **valuing personal time**. In future posts, I intend to cover my overall experience living in different countries and how that has shaped my worldview.

I speak Hindi, English, Bengali, Telugu, and Japanese. I haven't yet picked up the German language any further than _Entschuldigung_, _Danke Schön_, _Hähnchen Döner Einmal Bitte_ and all the numbers. I intend to, and hopefully I will get a better grasp of the language by the end of this year.

I love programming. I love fixing all my minor problems in life as much as possible using technology and programming. I like putting them up online for other people to use for free as open source projects. I will discuss a few of those projects in detail in my future posts.

I am emphatic about the significance of recommender systems, generative systems, which the world collectvely refers to as AI. I believe we are at a significant crossroads where all the companies will soon become AI companies, as they will all have to integrate AI into their products in one way or another. That is the only natural progression for any new technology that improves every aspect of life. It is like 10-15 years ago when every company started turning into a software company of varying scales.

I am extremely interested in knowing our beginning and the origin of the universe. I want to know how life began. I am comfortable with the theory of [panspermia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia), but I wouldn't go on to support the theory that [Octopuses are aliens](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610718300798). Dark matter interests me, and I want to see how far we go to understand it.

I read books. Lately, I have listened to a lot of audiobooks during my commute. Autobiographies interest me the most. Fiction, not so much. I will share any interesting book that I come across here as well.

So, that's me! I hope I stick to a disciplined way of blogging instead of wearing myself out from this sudden surge of motivation to write this blog.
