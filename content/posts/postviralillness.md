I was infected with some kind of virus in the end of August. I had a week long symptoms comprising fever, weakness and cough. It was all good after that till it wasn't anymore.\
After 4 days, my head started spinning and I started feeling extremely dizzy. That lasted for a week. And then I was fine for another 4 days before a strong fatigue set in.
And the dizzy that struck me after that, stayed with me continuously for the next 2 months.

In between, I had been to 4 different doctors to get checked up only to find no concrete diagnosys. I was prescribed an anti-biotic for a while in an assymption that I had a follow-on synus infection after the viral infection.
The doctor could not find anything alarming. One of the doctors wanted to test my balance system for the dizziness but he gave me a diagnosys date of after 5 weeks. It was extremely disappointing to see that but it was the only way forward as it is difficult to get appointments for specialists in the public health insurance.

I continued visiting the general physician that I was going to who was constantly asking me to have more vitamin substitutes due to the lack of sun in Germany. I kept doing it but to no avail. This time my doctor asked me to get a blood test done after 2 months of my complaining of the dizziness. It was only after that, that we got to know that there was a severe viral infection in my body a few months ago which has still inflamed my body internally.

He did an ultrasound to check my Spleen but he found nothing. He requested another blood test whereby my inflamation numbers had improved and therefore he did not do anything further. He had sent me on a sick leave for 2 weeks which helped with my work reponsibilities. But it did not cure me even then. However, slowly after that, it started getting a bit better. The constant dizziness converted into episodes of dizziness after every few days that would last for a day or two. My current state is that I still get dizzy every few days or maybe a week but its intensity might have subdued and the fatigue sets in not so frequently as well.

Perhaps the only thing that healed me was sleep which I did not have a lot to be honest but the sick leave did allow me to rest at home. It has been 3 months since the time I got sick and I feel it will last for another month.
