      <description>I was infected with some kind of virus in the end of August. I had a week long symptoms comprising fever, weakness and cough. It was all good after that till it wasn&amp;rsquo;t anymore.
After 4 days, my head started spinning and I started feeling extremely dizzy. That lasted for a week. And then I was fine for another 4 days before a strong fatigue set in. And the dizzy that struck me after that, stayed with me continuously for the next 2 months.</description>
