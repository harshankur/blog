      <description>When I first heard that AI will replace software developers soon, I thought it could not have been true as it is just a large language model as of now and not so much of an &amp;lsquo;intelligence&amp;rsquo; in any sense or form. Turns out, I was both right and wrong. It is trained well enough to support a developer but not to operate independently with simple instructions. So, it will take over a few people&amp;rsquo;s jobs, but that would be of the low-skilled software developers who only get to make a couple of small modules in the product at best.</description>
