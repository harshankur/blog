      <description>When I first heard that AI will replace software developers soon, I thought it could not have been true as it is just a large language model as of now and not so much of an &amp;lsquo;intelligence&amp;rsquo; in any sense or form. Turns out, I was both right and wrong. It is trained well enough to support a developer but not to operate independently with simple instructions. So, it will take over a few people&amp;rsquo;s jobs, but that would be of the low-skilled software developers who only get to make a couple of small modules in the product at best.</description>

      <description>What are iOS Shortcuts Shortcuts is a visual-scripting tool available on the Apple ecosystem which allows users to create macros for executing specific tasks on their device(s). These task sequences can be created by the user and shared online through iCloud. iOS Shortcuts can be a really powerful tool if it is used properly. It has some very advanced automation and scripting possibilities built into it and its best part is that it is available on a mobile device.</description>

      <title>How I Setup View Counter on Raspberry Pi Zero W</title>

      <description>I like working on my own mini-projects in my free time. Some of them are libraries or extensions and others are websites. The libraries or extensions are distributed from their own package manager of browser web store which keep a track of all the downloads from across the world. It gets a little tricky for the websites if I do not want to inject a random script on my website that shows a hideously looking view counter from the 2000s.</description>

      <title>Setting Up This Blog ðŸ’»</title>

      <description>Setting up this blog has been long in the running. I wanted a minimal design with not a lot of flashy UI stuff. Further, I did not want an overly complicated blog system.
After a lot of investigation (and constantly saying NO to wordpress ðŸ˜›), I landed upon Hugo to setup this blog. It was extremely easy to do it.
I found the documentation of Hugo quite resourceful and the online community is always at your fingertips.</description>
