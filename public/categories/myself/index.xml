      <description>I was infected with some kind of virus in the end of August. I had a week long symptoms comprising fever, weakness and cough. It was all good after that till it wasn&amp;rsquo;t anymore.
After 4 days, my head started spinning and I started feeling extremely dizzy. That lasted for a week. And then I was fine for another 4 days before a strong fatigue set in. And the dizzy that struck me after that, stayed with me continuously for the next 2 months.</description>

      <description>This particular feeling hits home to me quite often. We live in an ever changing world where progressing time is the only constant. We are often consumed in our fast moving life and before we know it, we have moved far ahead without appreciating the good things that we once had.
I have never lived in one place for more than 5 years at a stretch except the place where I grew up, Kolkata, where I stayed for 6 years.</description>

      <description>I am happy to have finally set up this blog, which I had been intending to for the last few months. The primary objective for me in setting up this blog is to have a place of my own to dump my thoughts, my learnings, my experiences, and anything else I find useful to share with the world. I am aware that only a few people will ever discover this blog, but I am glad to finally have one that is not on social media.</description>
