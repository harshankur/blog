      <description>Introduction Have you ever struggled with debugging your code on remote servers? There are usually two issues associated with debugging on remote hosting.
You are not well versed with terminal-based editors like Vim and Nano
Coding locally, uploading to GitHub, downloading on remote server, and restarting servers with updating code is tiresome
Well, I have the perfect way for you! You can connect your Visual Studio Code application to your remote server directly via SSH.</description>

      <description>Setting up this blog has been long in the running. I wanted a minimal design with not a lot of flashy UI stuff. Further, I did not want an overly complicated blog system.
After a lot of investigation (and constantly saying NO to wordpress üòõ), I landed upon Hugo to setup this blog. It was extremely easy to do it.
I found the documentation of Hugo quite resourceful and the online community is always at your fingertips.</description>

      <description>I am happy to have finally set up this blog, which I had been intending to for the last few months. The primary objective for me in setting up this blog is to have a place of my own to dump my thoughts, my learnings, my experiences, and anything else I find useful to share with the world. I am aware that only a few people will ever discover this blog, but I am glad to finally have one that is not on social media.</description>
